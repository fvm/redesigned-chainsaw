# Redesigned Chainsaw

Advent of Code 2021

Some exercises in programming for 2021

## Day 00
Overzealous attempts at trying to relearn idiomatic Go by trying to define reusable interfaces.

## Day 01
About four hours of struggling with trying to do things properly (and doing it wrong), followed by around thirty minutes beating [zap](https://github.com/uber-go/zap) into submission interspersed with about fifteen minutes of actually solving the puzzle.

There's a lesson to be learned there.

## Day 02
Nothing much to think about. Could probably run faster with some tweaking of the `bufio.Scanner`, but that's really 
not worth any effort. Also, tests weren't really necessary here.

I've learned yesterday's lesson, for now.
